### Notes
This project was for a capstone class. It's a web application using the MVC model. Using SQL for the database, specifically the Weber titan server. The whole idea was to make a website where users can apply for the Wildcat Micro Fund program. The Wildcat Micro fund is a Weber State University program that gave money to entrepreneurs and business owners. They divy up the money based on the application given to Weber State. This website was to facilitate and simplify the process for users and anyone keeping track of the data. A website that would solve the problem of applications in a database and provide a simple way for faculty and staff to rate the applications.

- This website was built on a team of 5 classmates.
- We were given about 8 weeks to build this from scratch. (Half a semester)
- The project is fully functional, but without the titan database it's missing the main component.
- The main functions of the program are through razor pages.
